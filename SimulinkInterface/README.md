### MIT LL Simulink Interface for DAIDALUS

This folder contains the necessary software to create a [Matlab S-function](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/sfg/what-is-an-s-function.html) for NASA's DAIDALUS v2.0.1c to interface with DEGAS.

To use DAIDALUS in DEGAS, you will need to first clone NASA's [DAIDALUS v2.0.1](https://github.com/nasa/daidalus/tree/DAIDALUSv2.0.1c) repository. Ensure that the path to the cloned repository does not contain any whitespaces. After cloning, follow the "Building DAIDALUS" instructions approriate for your operating system.

### Building DAIDALUS in Windows (with Visual Studio 2015)

1. Open Visual Studio 2015, click file -> New Project
    * Select *Visual C++* from templates
    * Under *Visual C++* select *Win32*, and then select *Win32 Project*.
    *. Choose an appropriate name for the project (e.g. daidalus) and the select a location to save the project.
    * Click *OK* The application wizard will then open.
        * Click *Next*
        * Select *Static Library*
        * Check off *Empty Project* (If this option is not available, select DLL, check the box, and then re-select static library)
        * De-select *Precompiled Header*
        * Click *Finish* to create the project

2. Ensure that *Solution Configuration* is set to release (by default it is set to debug)

3. Set the solution platform to *x64* (by default it is set to *x86*)

4. Add all DAIDALUS header files (*.h) and source files to the similarly named folders in Visual Studio solution explorer.
    * Go to *Projects* -> *Properties* -> *C/C++* -> *General*
    * Under *Additional Include Directories* add the path to the header files in the project folder

5. Click *Build* and then select *Build Solution*

6. The .lib file can be found in x64/Release

7. Move the .lib file to the directory pointed at by *make_daidalus_sfunc.m*, or amend the path to the file

### Building DAIDALUS in Linux

1. Open NASA's provided Makefile, which can be found in the C++ folder

2. Add -fPIC to the list of CXXFLAGS in the Makefile

3. Run the command *make lib* to build the library

4. The .a file can be found in C++/lib

5. Move the .a file to the directory pointed at by *make_daidalus_sfunc.m*, or amend the path to the file

### Creating the S-Function

1. Run make_daidalus_sfunc.m to generate the mex file. This script must be run from the SimulinkInterface folder. If running in Windows, a .mexw64 file will be generated. If running in Linux, a .mexa64 file will be generated. 

### Using with DEGAS

Before using DAIDALUS with DEGAS, ensure that the SimulinkInterface folder is on your Matlab path.
Directions on how to do this can be found in the *Quick Start* section of the DEGAS README located in the DEGAS folder.

### DAIDALUS 1.0.1 vs. 2.0.1

DAIDALUS v2 added additional vertical speed/vertical speed band pairs. The Pilot Model used by DEGAS only uses a subset of both the horizontal and vertical bands: -135 to 135 degrees for horizontal and -1500 to 1000 ft for vertical.
